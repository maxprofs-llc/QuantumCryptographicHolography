# QuantumCryptographicHolography
Quantum Mechanics is a chaotic environment, QCH as a Software has solved this problem and has brought order to the chaos. Using Holography, this repository aims to develop algorithms that will assign cryptographic keys to vectors/pixels in a Pre-Defined Image Table. Once assigned these cryptographic algorithms will work along side 'Dimensional' mechanisms to encrypt Libraries. This software once fully developed has the potential to work along-side Li-Fi hardware to create Server-to-Server Encryption that is uncrackable. It also allows for Ultra-High Compression, The potential to encrypt &amp; compress a full server stack of data into a single image of only a few Mbs in size. The potential is also there to Create an Internet 2.0 where the whole of the Internet can be stored on your device; all information accessible via search functions &amp; can be updated via lower thirds on a Digital TV channel received on a new smartphone. I will not add any further info to this repository, other than this is very revolutionary.
